# telstra-java-challenge

1. My interpretation of the requirement was that it was for a library that could be built into a jar for inclusion in
another program. I therefore did not make a runnable standalone jar.

2. Since there is no UI, the library can be demonstrated by running the class TestCarStore as a JUnit test. This is not
a set of comprehensive unit tests, which the spec did not call for, but demonstration of the code.

3. If the code is built into a jar using Maven, output is put in the telstra-car\target directory.
